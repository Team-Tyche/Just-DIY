## Description ##

For this teamwork assignment we have developed SPA web application. The project is title JustDIY, which stand for Just do it yourself. The goal of the application is to teach people how to build cool gadgets and write software for them. Everybody has a choice - they can either create tutorials on a subject they are proficient in or browse the ones provided from others. All the content in the application is user-generated. All guides fall into two different categories - software and hardware. Currently every guide provides a written description, but there is room for improvement as it could be extended to support video tutorials.
